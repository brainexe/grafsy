This is a very light proxy for graphite metrics with additional features:

- Taking metrics from network (see configuration) or from file directly
- Buffering metrics if Graphite itself is down
- Function of summing/averaging metrics with a special prefix (see configuration)
- Filtering 'bad' metrics, which are not passing check against regexp
- Periodical sending to Graphite server to avoid traffic pikes
